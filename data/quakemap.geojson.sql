Smaller settlements on the outskirts of Langtang, such as Chyamki, Thangsyap, and Mundu were also buried. It is impossible to determine exactly how many people died there, but the estimate is perhaps over 300 people in total. The handful of survivors, roughly twelve locals and two foreigners, walked down to Ghodatabela below after spending the night of the 25th in a cave - thus there is no one at Langtang itself. This avalanche is perhaps 2-3 kilometers wide, and is obstructing movement within the upper valley corridor. Currently two large groups are stranded above and below (due to several intensive and recurring landslides in the steep sections between Ghodatabela and Lama Hotel). Above, at Kyangjin Gompa, there were reportedly fewer casualties (perhaps 5-10) yet many injured. Most of the injured have been evacuated via helicopter and there is an army medic team in place. Yet, currently, the problem is one of food shortage and illness. I have heard that the majority of the settlement, including the gompa, is remarkably intact. There is a smaller group of about 30-40 at the settlement of Sindum, about 4km below Kyangjin and closer to Langtang. This group has excavated several bodies from the major avalanche zone. They have also evacuated many of the injured, but are facing severe food shortages and illness (hopefully remedied by Nepal Army reinforcements and supplies on the evening of the 27th.

He asked me to send you his report.  These notes are in hopes of your facilitation of much needed food to the three areas of Tsum.  Nubri, Lower and Upper Tsum.  Lotte has heard from his sister who is a nun at Rachen Gompa near Burji.  The Gompa is easy to see from the air.  It has a red plaster and stone fence around the property.\n\n1.  Barpak is approximately 30-40 miles from Chhokang Paro in Upper Tsum.  The trail to Tsum goes up the Budhi Gandaki and most likely completely unusable because of landslides. There are no roads into any part of Tsum. Helicopter is only way in now. \n\n2.  There are approximately 10-11,000 people in all of Tsum Valley.\n\n3.  The people are in desperate need of food.  Rice, wheat, noodles, cooking oil and vegetables are important.\n\nThere were water taps in the villages and we don''t know if they are still working.  There is a river through the main valley for Upper and Lower Tsum for water supplies.\n\n4. They request warm clothes for babies, kids and adults.  The Upper Tsum sits at about 10,000 ft (over 3,000 meters).  It is very cold there right now.\n\n5.  Chhokang Paro seems to be the hardest hit by the quake.  We know the village of Chhokang Paro is completely leveled. No structures exist now.  Unfortunately the grain and food for humans and livestock in mixed into the mess of rocks, timbers and water - and completely lost.  This is a huge humanitarian crisis as there is no way to resupply these residents by land. \nIt is reported there is less structural damage as one goes up the valley toward Mu Gompa.\n\n6.  In Lower Tsum - Ripchet had a substantial fire in the village.  There might be injuries there.  We don''t know. We have not heard from Chumling. The trail is blocked. There is no electricity or communication in the valley.\n\n7.  Nubri is to the west of these areas of Tsum and we don''t know what has happened there.  Tsum residents have not been able to communicate with them. But it is similar to Lower and Upper Tsum - and very hard to travel there. There is a major monastery at Surang Gompa nearish to Nubri.  We don''t know how they fared in the quake.\n\n8.  In Upper Tsum there are plenty of open fields to land an helicopter...near Chhokang Paro.  There are fields to the immediate south of Ripchet in which to land.  There is a new trekkers'' lodge at Burji and a field just to the immediate north for landing.  If the copter goes over a Mr. Dhawa Lama will probably come out to direct the copter to a landing spot.  There is a grassy field behind his lodge.  He is there now with some French trekkers.\n\n9.  There is a nun at Domje in Lower Tsum who is trained as a dentist and doctor. She might be a big help if she can be contacted and given medical supplies.','28.58','85.12','Chhokangparo, Gandaki, Western Region, Nepal','','2015-09-30T02:58:06+00:00','null','quakemap','text','');

So, he requested to provide tent for 85 families including food.\n\nIn the wake of the recent earthquake in Nepal and its severe impact in Sindhupalchowk, there have been a number of NGOs, informal organisations, individuals and the Nepalese government working to provide basic relief aid to a number of VDCs. However, as these efforts have not been coordinated and as no supply chain has been established as of yet, our efforts have not been effective and aid has not been distributed in an equitable manner. Many villages, where there is no road access, for instance have not received any support and this is causing local anger, tension and is hampering the aid delivery and distribution process. \nIn order to address this and to support the work undertaken by the many organisations and individuals, Clean up Nepal is undertaking a district-wide survey of the open shelters and number of people at each shelter in order to create a database that will assist organisations to contribute to needs more effectively.\n\nWe are seeking 200 proactive, independent and self-motivated individuals to collect this data at different VDCs of Sindhupalchowk tomorrow on the 3rd of May 2015. As many of these VDCs are not accessible by bus, we will require at least 100 individuals to have their own mode of transport, i.e. bikes. Data collection will take place in pairs and each pair will be required to collect data from one VDC. There are 79 VDCs in Sindhupalchowk.

Posted to Facebook group, Nepal Earthquake Response )12:00, EDT\n&quot;I am Raksha, a doctor working at Namche clinic. \nAs you know that after the earthquakes in Nepal, people have lost lives, shelters and properties and have ever since been living in fear. \n\nRemote villages in Nepal are facing huge challenges and are in dire need of aid. Among such villages are Thame, Khunde, Khumjung and many more that are north of Solukhumbu. These villages are yet to see any relief aids from the government and many have lost hope that there will be any. We are glad to see the local community get united and help each other in such time.\n\nThe earthquake has left most of the houses inhabitable and villagers have taken shelter in makeshift tents. This had led to people catching flu, respiratory infection, diarrhea diseases at a very fast pace. We fear that unhygienic and crowded living conditions with extreme weather will soon invite even more diseases.\n\nDue to the extreme weather condition that people have to face everyday, everyone is looking forward to rebuild their homes as soon as possible which is very difficult considering the scarcity of home builders and carpenters right now. We presume it will take months to years before there will be any semblance to normalcy here. \n\nPeople did call me they would help bring aid here but they never called back nor did they bring any help. \n\n**(May 26 2015)\nAccording to Rakshya, the relief mentioned by CDO is not provided yet.There is 60- 70 household in each V.D.C. Relief materials are distributed by Private organizations and gumba but its not evenly distributed. Most of the upper villages like Khunde, Khumjung, Bhorpse, Khawa etc. have received tarps but not food stuffs yet. Some foriegner provided some tea and biscuits to selective needy people.Sanitary need ( Sanitizer, soaps, toilet paper, Bucket tap) is mentioned. Its raining, snowing and storming there. Although tents are distributed following needs are mentioned as well(for rebuilding):- 1. Zinc roofs 2. Cement 3. Labour/ volunteer to build temporary house. 4. Safety helmet (rubble clearing)\n\nPlease let me know if there can be any help from your side.

Most spend their days in what was left of their damaged houses. The health post has only one room still standing, which is still being used.
