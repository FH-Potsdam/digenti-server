I posted this to show another side of the earthquake story. Everyone running out and congregating in a town not-so-affected by the quake, yet close enough to feel the fear of the rumble. It was a brief yet nice sense of community that unfortunately is not so commonly felt here as a land for tourists (and hippies, apparently).

The Nepal government has declared a state of
emergency in the affected districts and appealed for
international humanitarian assistance. Kathmandu
Valley and surrounding districts are worst affected,
According to the Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam

Aftershocks of equal magnitudes are still causing more damage.

The death toll in Nepal’s earthquake could reach 10,000, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala has said, as survivors’ despair turned to anger at the government’s slow response to the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the country, with food, water and other essentials in desperately short supply.

“The government is doing all it can for rescue and relief on a war footing,” Koirala said in an interview with Reuters. “It is a challenge and a very difficult hour for Nepal.”

The death toll in Nepal alone rose to 4,352 on Tuesday, with more than 8,000 injured, according to police, amid warnings the full extent of the tragedy would not be known until rescue teams had reached “flattened” villages in remote regions.
Kindly share and spread the awareness.

What it means? (Animation)','This animated video explains what the Magnitude of the Earthquake on Richter Scale  means and how devastating it could be with every increment of every value.on Richter Scale.

What is Ricter Scale: The Richter magnitude scale (also Richter scale) assigns a magnitude number to quantify the energy released by an earthquake. The Richter scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, which defines magnitude as the logarithm of the ratio of the amplitude of the seismic waves to an arbitrary, minor amplitude.

As measured with a seismometer, an earthquake that registers 5.0 on the Richter scale has a shaking amplitude 10 times that of an earthquake that registered 4.0, and thus corresponds to a release of energy 31.6 times that released by the lesser earthquake.

Developed in the 1930s, it was succeeded in the 1970s by the Moment Magnitude Scale (MMS) which is now the scale used to estimate magnitudes for all modern large earthquakes by the United States Geological Survey. However, earthquake magnitudes are still sometimes incorrectly reported as "an earthquake of XX on the Richter scale", when the correct terminology using the MMS is "a magnitude XX earthquake.','28.39486','84.12401','','','2015-05-13T15:22:16.000Z','','youtube','video','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coXxz_M4gHQ');

The sleepy, all-seeing Buddha eyes that stare out from the top have become the quintessential symbol of Nepal.
When this temple was founded about 2,000 years ago, Kathmandu Valley was filled with a great lake. According to Buddhist legend, a single perfect lotus grew in the center of the lake. When the bodhisattva Manjusri drained the lake with a slash of his sword, the lotus flower settled on top of the hill and magically transformed into the stupa. Thus it is known as the Self-Created (swayambhu) Stupa.

The earliest written record of the Swayambunath Stupa''s existence is a 5th-century stone inscription, but scholars believe there was probably a shrine here as early as the 1st century. Even before that, it is likely that animist rites took place on this hill. Swayambunath is one of Nepal''s oldest Buddhist temples and it has an ancient atmosphere, especially when one approaches on foot with the pilgrims.','27.7','85.33333','','','2015-05-06T16:59:05.000Z','','youtube','video','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxNO1Cf4dqU');

Phulkharka village near the epicenter was one of the hard hit villages, where 27 people lost their lives, 95% houses were destroyed and hundreds of cattle were buried in rubble. 
Phulkharka is located in the foothills of Ganesh Himal (4,429 m), 135 km northwest of Kathmandu. The main income of the village is agriculture with majority of its men working in Middle East or in Kathmandu earning supplementary income for the family. Because of climate depended traditional farming, agriculture is subsistence.
The village is perched high up along the flank for 3,200 m mountain with scenic higher reaches offering panoramic view of Manaslu and Ganesh Himal range. Its pristine, forested higher reaches make a beautiful short trek. The village is also culturally rich with its ethnic diversity. Tamangs here still practice Shamanism in its intact form. Because of forested higher reaches, the village is source of water for surrounding 5 village development committees.   
Phulkharka village development with population of about 7,500 people has 7 primary schools and one high school. All school buildings were destroyed in the tremor sighting the need of more sophisticated, earthquake proof school buildings which could be used as shelters in case of natural disaster. 
Ganga Jamuna Youth club has been providing immediate relief materials and volunteers to erect temporary shelters. The aftershocks, government policies and soon coming monsoon will delay the construction of permanent structures by few months. We are planning to mobilize more volunteers to accomplish the task of rebuilding. 
We would like to request international and nation communities to support us in the campaign by technical or financial aid. 
We need skilled volunteers and technicians in construction. Please visit the link for further information. http://www.itournepal.com/volunteernepal.php

The name Manakamana means “having one’s wishes fulfilled”. Hence, Manakamana in Gorkha is one of the most visited temples in Nepal where devotees from all over Nepal and abroad throng the temple daily to offer prayers and sacrifices to the goddess in the belief that this will fulfill their wishes. Venerated since the 17th century, it is believed that Goddess Manakamana grants the wishes of all those who make the pilgrimage to her shrine to worship her. Earlier times the only way to reach the Manakamana temple was by walking uphill for about three hours. Now, there is a cable car that runs from the cable station of Cheres, just 5 kms east of Mugling to Manakamana. The cable car rides over the distance of 2.8 kms in 10 minutes more or less. 
The temple is a two-tiered pagoda built in a large courtyard. Goddess Manakamana is enshrined in the form of a shila, or a large boulder, inside the temple. There are four other boulders adjacent to it representing the deities Bhairab, Ganesh, Kumari and Betaal.
Legend has it that the temple originated during the reign of King Ram Shah of Gorkha, ancestor of the Shah kings, in the 16th century. The queen was believed to be the incarnation of Goddess Durga. So when the king died, as per the Sati customs then, the queen prepared to burn herself on her husband’s funeral pyre. She told her most faithful servant that she would be reborn as a goddess in the form of a shila, and he and his successors were to worship her. The temple thus came into being at the spot where the shila was found. The “pujari”, or main priest, at the temple is a Magar by ethnicity as per the directives of the Sati queen.
The temple lies in Gorkha from where the unification of Nepal started under King Prithvi Narayan Shah. The Shah kings of Nepal were great devotees of this deity. Devotees make offerings of animal sacrifices to the goddess. Especially Saturdays and Tuesdays see maximum rush when it takes hours just to get a glimpse of the goddess in the temple.','27.7','85.33333','','','2015-05-09T15:26:25.000Z','','youtube','video','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxQzEXXpiIM');

We’re still looking into the best way to go about using the money received. As you know, the situation here is still quite chaotic. The lack of communication between organisations can sometimes make it difficult to bring help to the right places at the right time. We wish to take the time to evaluate how things evolve over the next couple of weeks, whilst we receive donations. The help we would like to bring will be focused on the long term, once the initial crisis is over and the media attention somewhat dissolved. We are in contact with certain members of the local community as well as heads of charities that act throughout the region that can counsel us so that the collected funds may be of the best possible use.

Rest assured that your donations will be used in the best interest of the villagers of Langtang Valley, and that you will be kept informed, on our Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/helplangtang -  on the evolution of our project in the most accurate way possible.

KATHMANDU:  Indian Air Force helicopters are rescuing people from the remotest parts of western Nepal, difficult to reach and among the worst affected by Saturday''s earthquake that has killed over 4,000 people.

NDTV accompanied one such Air Force rescue mission to two villages in the Dhanding district, near China. Landing in this terrain is a challenge, made more difficult by inclement weather in Nepal over the last few days.

Entire villages have been flattened by the powerful 7.9-magnitude earthquake. In these two small villages, 300 people are dead.

The IAF choppers are carrying tonnes of relief material - tents, noodles, medicines and water - neatly packaged in white parcels to distribute in the villages.
As they land, personnel of the Nepalese army take over the relief material.

In the meantime, vehicles of the Nepalese Red Cross ferry the most critically injured to the Indian helicopters, to be airlifted to base camp for treatment.','27.7','85.33333','','','2015-04-28T09:19:29.000Z','','youtube','video','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUha8bKjg0Q');
