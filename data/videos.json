The Richter scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, which defines magnitude as the logarithm of the ratio of the amplitude of the seismic waves to an arbitrary, minor amplitude.\n\nAs measured with a seismometer, an earthquake that registers 5.0 on the Richter scale has a shaking amplitude 10 times that of an earthquake that registered 4.0, and thus corresponds to a release of energy 31.6 times that released by the lesser earthquake.\n\nDeveloped in the 1930s, it was succeeded in the 1970s by the Moment Magnitude Scale (MMS) which is now the scale used to estimate magnitudes for all modern large earthquakes by the United States Geological Survey.

      "description": "Perched atop a hill on the western edge of the Kathmandu Valley, the ancient Swayambunath Stupa (known to tourists as the Monkey Temple), a UNESCO world heritage site, is Kathmandu's most important Buddhist shrine. The sleepy, all-seeing Buddha eyes that stare out from the top have become the quintessential symbol of Nepal.\nWhen this temple was founded about 2,000 years ago, Kathmandu Valley was filled with a great lake. According to Buddhist legend, a single perfect lotus grew in the center of the lake. When the bodhisattva Manjusri drained the lake with a slash of his sword, the lotus flower settled on top of the hill and magically transformed into the stupa. Thus it is known as the Self-Created (swayambhu) Stupa.\n\nThe earliest written record of the Swayambunath Stupa's existence is a 5th-century stone inscription, but scholars believe there was probably a shrine here as early as the 1st century. Even before that, it is likely that animist rites took place on this hill. Swayambunath is one of Nepal's oldest Buddhist temples and it has an ancient atmosphere, especially when one approaches on foot with the pilgrims.",

      "description": "The 7.8 magnitude earthquake of April 25 took over 8,500 lives and destroyed about 2,00,000 houses. Phulkharka village near the epicenter was one of the hard hit villages, where 27 people lost their lives, 95% houses were destroyed and hundreds of cattle were buried in rubble. \nPhulkharka is located in the foothills of Ganesh Himal (4,429 m), 135 km northwest of Kathmandu. The main income of the village is agriculture with majority of its men working in Middle East or in Kathmandu earning supplementary income for the family. Because of climate depended traditional farming, agriculture is subsistence.\nThe village is perched high up along the flank for 3,200 m mountain with scenic higher reaches offering panoramic view of Manaslu and Ganesh Himal range. Its pristine, forested higher reaches make a beautiful short trek. The village is also culturally rich with its ethnic diversity. Tamangs here still practice Shamanism in its intact form. Because of forested higher reaches, the village is source of water for surrounding 5 village development committees.   \nPhulkharka village development with population of about 7,500 people has 7 primary schools and one high school. All school buildings were destroyed in the tremor sighting the need of more sophisticated, earthquake proof school buildings which could be used as shelters in case of natural disaster. \nGanga Jamuna Youth club has been providing immediate relief materials and volunteers to erect temporary shelters. The aftershocks, government policies and soon coming monsoon will delay the construction of permanent structures by few months. We are planning to mobilize more volunteers to accomplish the task of rebuilding. \nWe would like to request international and nation communities to support us in the campaign by technical or financial aid. \nWe need skilled volunteers and technicians in construction.

      "description": "The Manakamana Temple situated in the Gorkha district of Nepal is the sacred place of the Hindu Goddess Bhagwati, an incarnation of Parvati. The name Manakamana means “having one’s wishes fulfilled”. Hence, Manakamana in Gorkha is one of the most visited temples in Nepal where devotees from all over Nepal and abroad throng the temple daily to offer prayers and sacrifices to the goddess in the belief that this will fulfill their wishes. Venerated since the 17th century, it is believed that Goddess Manakamana grants the wishes of all those who make the pilgrimage to her shrine to worship her. Earlier times the only way to reach the Manakamana temple was by walking uphill for about three hours. Now, there is a cable car that runs from the cable station of Cheres, just 5 kms east of Mugling to Manakamana. The cable car rides over the distance of 2.8 kms in 10 minutes more or less. \nThe temple is a two-tiered pagoda built in a large courtyard. Goddess Manakamana is enshrined in the form of a shila, or a large boulder, inside the temple. There are four other boulders adjacent to it representing the deities Bhairab, Ganesh, Kumari and Betaal.\nLegend has it that the temple originated during the reign of King Ram Shah of Gorkha, ancestor of the Shah kings, in the 16th century. The queen was believed to be the incarnation of Goddess Durga. So when the king died, as per the Sati customs then, the queen prepared to burn herself on her husband’s funeral pyre. She told her most faithful servant that she would be reborn as a goddess in the form of a shila, and he and his successors were to worship her. The temple thus came into being at the spot where the shila was found. The “pujari”, or main priest, at the temple is a Magar by ethnicity as per the directives of the Sati queen.\nThe temple lies in Gorkha from where the unification of Nepal started under King Prithvi Narayan Shah. The Shah kings of Nepal were great devotees of this deity. Devotees make offerings of animal sacrifices to the goddess. Especially Saturdays and Tuesdays see maximum rush when it takes hours just to get a glimpse of the goddess in the temple.",

One guy who saw collapse of Kasthamandap with his own eyes says that, when earthquake started at around 12 noon on 25th of April, people became terrifed and ran inside Kasthamandap. Those who ran inside it became victim of its fall. People who were donating blood, medical personnel as well as local were killed and injured. It is so tragic. I shot this vedio around Kasthamandap. Today also there is earthquake shock at around 5 PM Nepal Time.\n\nUNSEEN & UNCENCORED videos of \"Nepal Earthquake 2015\":\n\n1.
